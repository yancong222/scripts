What kind of energy is this? ; $context$ = A subatomic particle of energy charge. From this and other discoveries, scientists rapidly built up the theory that every kind of atom is made up of the same subatomic particles ( see Nuclear Energy ). That means that every single electron and subatomic particle of energy effects every other electron and subatomic particle of energy. This material decays spontaneously and releases subatomic particles and electromagnetic energy . radioactive An unstable isotope that decays spontaneously and releases subatomic particles or units of energy. When chlorophyll P680 absorbs sunlight, what subatomic particle actually has a change in energy content? The detector is designed to stop as many as possible of the subatomic particles created from energy released by colliding proton\\/antiproton beams. When the nuclei change in  structure, energy and\\/or subatomic particles are given off. When the particles are made to collide an electron and its anti-particle, the positron, annihilate each other releasing a high energy burst. At the subatomic level these subatomic particles are not made of energy, but they are themselves energy.\",\"output\":\"$answer$ = nuclear\"},\n",
