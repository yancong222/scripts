# Scripts and modified code for experiments in linguistic meaning and beyond [ongoing work on transformers: https://github.com/yancong222/SSD-LM-STanglab] by Yan Cong, 2018-present 

  - This folder contains scripts and modified code (Python, R, javascript, Matlab, html) written or modified by Yan Cong during the PhD degree at Michigan State University.
  - There are eight subfolders, each representing a different study. Each subfolder contains its own Readme file with a summary of the contents of that folder.

## [PsychoPy3 expepriments] subfolder: 
Web-based and lab-based experiments implemented in PsychoPy (participants: neurotypical; Chinese speakers; English speakers).

## [artificial language learning] subfolder: 
General cognition tasks such as rule learning and testing (participants: neurotypical; English speakers).

## [behavioral experiments] subfolder: 
Characterize linguistic universals through measuring human participants' reaction times, reading times, and language decisions  (participants: neurotypical and neuroatypical; Chinese speakers; English speakers).

## [confusion matrix] subfolder: 
Acoustic analysis of speech data (participants: neurotypical; Chinese speakers; English speakers).

## [evaluate transformers] subfolder:
